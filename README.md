- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gio99c/mental-health-counselor.git
cd mental-health-counselor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
export MONGODB_DATABASE="mental_health"
export MONGODB_COLLECTION="conversations"
```

4. Launch the application:
```bash
